# USERS DATA TABLE

Test test task for one of the IT companies. The goal was to implement the rendering data as a table with the ability to add data (new user), change an existing user, delete a user. The added / corrected user should be placed in the first row of the table. Adding and correcting should be processed through modal windows with a form (validation is required - until all input fields are filled in, the submit button will be disabled). According to the task, the state of the application should be handled with the internal React state.
